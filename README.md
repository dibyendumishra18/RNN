# Reinforcement-Learning
This repository contains code for reinforcement learning that I 
go on learning and implementing as I dwelve further into this field.

This repository contains two major parts as of now - 
- <b>Sutton-Book</b>- Implementation of codes from the [book](http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/~straka/courses/npfl114/2016/sutton-bookdraft2016sep.pdf) by Sutton and Barto.
- <b>CS294-Berkeley</b>- Assignment from the course on [Deep Reinforcement learning](http://rll.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/) offered at Berkeley
